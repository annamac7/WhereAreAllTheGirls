          The code replaces the problems with solutions. To start, it converts problems and solutions into variables which are then placed into an array (an object that is able to hold multiple variables). The code then loops through the array 4 times (for the number of problems in the problem array). For each loop it subtracts the problem from the current situation and replaces it with a solution. This new data is stored in a new array called "fixedSolution". <br> To see the results click "console.log(fixedSolution)"
